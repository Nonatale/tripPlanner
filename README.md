# tripPlanner
A web project about planning for events/trips


## Description

TrailCraft is a website intended to help the busy traveler stay organized when planning an upcoming vacation or event.  


## Installation

No installation steps are needed for this project as it is a web-based application.

## Usage

The user can access the site by visiting the url. When the user arrives on the Trips page they click on the Add Trip button, input the name of their trip and Submit. Their trip is then displayed on the page. The user has the option to add one or multiple trips. When the user wants to plan activities or events for a specific trip, they simply click on the name of the trip they are planning. They are then directed to the Events page. On this page they will see an Add Event button, Delete Trip button, and a list of any events they have added. If the user wants to add an event they must click on the Add Event button and add the title, date, time, place, and notes for the event. When the user clicks on the Submit button the event is then added to that page. The user also has the option to delete trips that are no longer applicable by clicking on the Delete Trip button. If the user chooses to delete the trip, they will be directed back to the Trips page and the deleted trip will no longer appear on this page. You can access this website in any number of browsers (Edge, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc).
